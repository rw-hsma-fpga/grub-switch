//! \brief Process USB device enumeration requests header file.
//!
//!  This file contains the USB endpoint 0 management routines corresponding to
//!  the standard enumeration process (refer to chapter 9 of the USB
//!  specification.
//!  This file calls routines of the usb_specific_request.c file for non-standard
//!  request management.
//!  The enumeration parameters (descriptor tables) are contained in the
//!  usb_descriptors.c file.
//!
//! - Compiler:           IAR EWAVR and GNU GCC for AVR
//! - Supported devices:  AT90USB1287, AT90USB1286, AT90USB647, AT90USB646
